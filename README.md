# Image Difference Analyzer

This Python script leverages computer vision techniques to compare and visualize differences between two images. Whether you're monitoring changes in surveillance footage, assessing design modifications, or scrutinizing variations in medical images, this tool simplifies the process of identifying alterations.

## Features
- **Correlation Coefficient:** Obtain a numerical measure of similarity between the two images using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
- **Visual Difference Analysis:** View side-by-side comparisons, binary masks, and filled images highlighting significant changes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily adapt the script for different image sets and scenarios with a modular design.

## How to Use
1. Replace 'one.jpg' and 'two.jpg' with your desired images.
2. Run the script to visualize differences, rectangles, and contours.

Feel free to customize and contribute to enhance its functionality!
